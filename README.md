# Volability - Crypto Dashboard

Welcome to Project Volability! This guide will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Node.js and npm (Node package manager)

## Python Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up your Python environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/GregAndrews169/FSD-Volability.git
    cd FSD-Volability
    ```

2. **Create the Python Virtual Environment**

    macOS/Linux:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Windows:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    macOS/Linux:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Windows:

    ```
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Local Server

With your environment set up and dependencies installed, start the local server by running:

python app.py

Your server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Setting Up the Frontend
